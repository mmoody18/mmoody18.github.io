            <h2>Website Evaluation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Your submission doesn't lead right to the page to be reviewed. Not Sure if we were instructed on this, but I had to find the website through github.</li>
                <li>There are no spaces or upper-cases in the file/folder names, including scripts, images, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Page has sufficient contrast/font sizing so as to be easy to read.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>CRAP</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Follows the CRAP principal of design.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Page Structure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Page has: Header, Main, Footer, and NAV.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Validation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Page is MISSING HTML validation button/link and validates.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Suggestions for Improvement:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I love the mock barbershop design and the unique name that is a play on words. Well done!</li>
                <li>Consider adding like an operation times based on each day and like a review section. Kind of like a real barbershop.</li>
