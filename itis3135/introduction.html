                <strong>Personal background:</strong> Hi I’m Max, and I grew up in Raleigh. I’m a transfer student from Wake Tech with an Associates in Cybersecurity. This is my second semester here at UNC Charlotte and I’m starting to pursue my bachelors degree. I always wanted to be a vet because I like animals, but really found a passion for computers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Academic background:</strong>  I graduated high school in 2021 and audibled from attending NC State and went to Wake Tech for 3 years(I changed my major whoops) and ended up deciding to attend UNCC. I’ve mostly gotten A’s and B’s with a couple C’s, but I’m trying to continue the strong start with a 4.0 GPA after 1 semester.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Background in this subject:</strong>  I’ve got a decent background in a lot of different coding languages and networking subjects. I’ve had one internship as an IT Auditor for The UNC School Systems Office. I won’t list all the subjects I’ve gotten experience in, but I have the most in Js, Java, and Python.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> I am used to tinkering and messing around with computers so I have a few, but the three I use the most are Windows 10/11 for my laptop and desktop and Ubuntu for an older PC I have that I test things on.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Courses I'm Taking & Why(oh boy get ready for this):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>ITCS-3160 Database Design & Implementation -</strong> I’ve taken a similar class before at Wake Tech, but it apparently doesn’t satisfy this requirement. Have to take it to learn the basics of databases.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>ITIS-3135 Web Based Programming -</strong> I love coding in JS or React so this sounds like an exciting class to learn because I suck at both. It is also the first required course of the cybersecurity concentration.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>ITSC-3146 Intro Oper Syst & Networking -</strong> I have used a lot of operating systems, but still don’t have the greatest idea about how they work, so this should be informative.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>ITSC-3155 Software Engineering -</strong> A major requirement in computer science and it’ll be cool to see what goes into coding software and how the actual design process goes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>ITSC-4850 Senior Project I -</strong> Got pretty lucky and connected with a really nice professor and ended up being able to work on my senior project early. Did some work with AI that he liked so he gave me a task for something he wanted to see be made.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>MATH-1241 Calculus I -</strong> Not a fan. Forced to take and is one of like five required math classes. Wish me luck…..
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Funny/Interesting item about yourself:</strong> I’ve broken two bones and have had 2 different surgeries. Neither of the surgeries had anything to do with the broken bones, which is funny to me.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>I'd also like to share:</strong> At this moment in time I don’t have anything really to share in particular, but instead I decided to really draw out this superb line of super interesting text/info so that you would then be able to read this masterfully well crafted run on sentence that takes up 4 lines on this document.
