            <h2>Website Evaluation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Your submission doesn't lead right to the page to be reviewed. Not Sure if we were instructed on this, but I had to find the website through github.</li>
                <li>There are no spaces or upper-cases in the file/folder names, including scripts, images, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The page has a well designed header and sidebar, but has a lack of color contrast in the main page. I don't mean to be offensive, but seems very bland and basic.</li>
                <li>Add the margin, width, and max-width to make it more readable.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Page Structure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Page has within it: Header, Main, Footer, and NAV.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Header</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Header is designed very well.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Validation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Page has HTML validation button/link and validates</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Suggestions for Improvement:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I really don't have much to critize so I'll harp on these 3 areas. I think it took me a little to figure out exactly what I was looking at. The initial concept of what you client project was, was not very clear to me. When it comes to the design and structure, I feel like some more contrasting colors and something that makes your content pop out and make it easier to read. It's a good project, just isn't "great" to me, but A worthy.</li>
